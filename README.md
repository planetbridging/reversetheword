Coding Challenge for Websockets
A websocket on port 8080 that responds to a message by reversing it!

The Challenge

Clone this repository to your local and get it running by using
`npm start`

You need to write a React SPA that connects the user to the websocket on load.

Once connected they should be able to send a message through the websocket and the reply should be printed on their screen.

You should keep a running log of the sent and received messages.

Please provide a nice chat interface! If you have any extension features you want to add go ahead :D

Please commit your code to github and send us the link when you are ready.

Thanks!
